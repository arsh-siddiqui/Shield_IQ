/**
 * Calculates a deterministic risk score and confidence from deduplicated signals.
 *
 * Scoring rationale (no random values):
 *   - HIGH severity signal  → 35 pts each (1 = 35, 2 = 70, 3+ capped at 100)
 *   - MEDIUM severity signal → 20 pts each
 *   - LOW severity signal    → 8 pts each
 *
 * A single high-severity signal alone (e.g., IP hostname, OTP request) = 35 pts → Low.
 * Two high signals (e.g., brand impersonation + credential path) = 70 pts → High.
 * Three medium signals = 60 pts → Medium (not High — requires a serious signal).
 * A single medium signal = 20 pts → Low.
 * No signals = 0 pts → Safe.
 *
 * Risk level bands match the existing frontend exactly:
 *   ≥70 → High | ≥40 → Medium | ≥15 → Low | <15 → Safe
 *
 * @param {Array} signals - Array of deduplicated signal objects.
 * @returns {{riskScore: number, confidence: number, riskLevel: string}}
